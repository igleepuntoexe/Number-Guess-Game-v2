# Number Guess Game v2
This is my Guess the number project in JavaScript but improved and with more useful lines of code such as, for example, instead of having infinite attempts you now have a limited number of attempts depending on the difficulty that the user has chosen, now it will appear for you Screen both the wrong numbers and numbers exceeded the level limit and if you fail then the number you had to guess will appear.
I hope it helps you and any suggestion is always accepted. My gmail is: adriiglesias2016@gmail.com, My discord is: igle.exe#8778 and my Twitter is @igleepuntoexe
